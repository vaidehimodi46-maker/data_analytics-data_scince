## Write an SQL query using CASE WHEN to classify orders in a 'FoodOrders' table as 'Small', 'Medium', or 'Large' based on the total_amount: 'Small' for less than 300, 'Medium' for 300 to 999, and 'Large' for 1000 and above

## Given a 'Movies' table with a 'rating' column (out of 10), write an SQL query that adds a new column 'popularity' which shows 'Blockbuster' for ratings 8 and above, 'Hit' for 5 to 7.9, and 'Average' for below 5 using CASE WHEN ELSE END

    SELECT name,rating,CASE WHEN rating >= 8 THEN 'Blockbuster' WHEN rating >= 5 THEN 'Hit' ELSE 'Average' END AS popularity FROM Movies;

## For a 'FlipkartProducts' table with a 'price' column, write an SQL query to create a 'price_category' column that bins prices as 'Budget' (below 500), 'Standard' (500 to 2000), and 'Premium' (above 2000) using CASE WHEN

    SELECT name,price,CASE WHEN price < 500 THEN 'Budget' WHEN price BETWEEN 500 AND 2000 THEN 'Standard' ELSE 'Premium' END AS price_category FROM FlipkartProducts;

## Write an SQL query for a 'SpotifyTracks' table that uses CASE WHEN to assign a 'duration_label' column: 'Short' for tracks under 180 seconds, 'Medium' for 180-300 seconds, and 'Long' for over 300 seconds

    SELECT price,CASE WHEN price < 500 THEN 'Budget' WHEN price BETWEEN 500 AND 2000 THEN 'Standard' ELSE 'Premium' END AS price_category FROM FlipkartProducts;
