## Given a table Orders with columns (order_id, user_id, order_date, total_amount), write an SQL query using ROW_NUMBER() to assign a unique sequential number to each order per user, ordered by order_date descending

    SELECT order_id,user_id,total_amount,order_date,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS order_number FROM Orders;


## Suppose you have a table called Songs with columns (song_id, artist, streams). Write an SQL query using RANK() to list each song along with its rank based on streams within each artist

        SELECT song_id,artist,streams,RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY artist ORDER By streams DESC) AS song_rank FROM Songs;    


## For a table named Movies with columns (movie_id, genre, rating), write an SQL query using DENSE_RANK() to assign a rank to each movie within its genre based on rating, with the highest rating getting rank 1

    SELECT movie_id,genre,rating,DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY genre ORDER BY rating DESC) AS movie_rank FROM Movies;


## Imagine a table named Influencers with columns (id, platform, followers). Write an SQL query to display the top 3 influencers per platform using ROW_NUMBER(), showing id, platform, followers, and their row number

 SELECT id,platform,followers, row_num FROM (SELECT id,platform,followers, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY platform ORDER BY followers DESC) AS row_num FROM Influencers)
 AS ranked_influencers WHERE row_num <= 3;
